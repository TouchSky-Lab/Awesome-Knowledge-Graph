# Triple Stores
- AllegroGraph - high-performance, persistent graph database that scales to billions of quads
- Apache Jena - open source Java framework for building Semantic Web and Linked Data applications
- Eclipse RDF4J - (formerly known as Sesame) is an open source Java framework for processing RDF data. This includes parsing, storing, inferencing and querying of/over such data. It offers an easy-to-use API that can be connected to all leading RDF storage solutions. It allows you to connect with SPARQL endpoints and create applications that leverage the power of linked data and Semantic Web.
- GraphDB - enterprise ready Semantic Graph Database, compliant with W3C Standards
- Virtuoso - a "Data Junction Box" that drives enterprise and individual agility by deriving a Semantic Web of Linked Data from existing data silos
- Hoply - explore bigger than RAM relational data in the comfort of Python.



# Graph Computing Framework

- GQL - An initiative to create a standard query language for property graph database, just like SQL for relational database.



# Knowledge Graph Dataset
- [BabelNet](https://babelnet.org/) - Both a multilingual encyclopedic dictionary, with lexicographic and encyclopedic coverage of terms, and a semantic network which connects concepts and named entities in a very large network of semantic relations, made up of about 16 million entries, called Babel synsets. Each Babel synset represents a given meaning and contains all the synonyms which express that meaning in a range of different languages.
- [Wikidata](https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Wikidata:Main_Page) - Wikidata is a free, collaborative, multilingual, secondary database, collecting structured data to provide support for Wikipedia, Wikimedia Commons, the other wikis of the Wikimedia movement, and to anyone in the world.
- [Google Knowledge Graph](https://developers.google.com/knowledge-graph/) - Googleâ€™s Knowledge Graph has millions of entries that describe real-world entities like people, places, and things.
- [DBpedia](https://wiki.dbpedia.org/) - DBpedia is a crowd-sourced community effort to extract structured content from the information created in various Wikimedia projects.
- [XLore](https://xlore.org/) - A large-scale English-Chinese bilingual knowledge graph by structuring and integrating Chinese Wikipedia, English Wikipedia, French Wikipedia, and Baidu Baike.
- [The GDELT Project](https://www.gdeltproject.org/) - The GDELT Project monitors the world's broadcast, print, and web news from nearly every corner of every country in over 100 languages and identifies the people, locations, organizations, themes, sources, emotions, counts, quotes, images and events driving our global society every second of every day, creating a free open platform for computing on the entire world.
- [YAGO](http://yago-knowledge.org/) - A huge semantic knowledge base, derived from Wikipedia, WordNet and GeoNames. Currently, YAGO has knowledge of more than 10 million entities (like persons, organizations, cities, etc.) and contains more than 120 million facts about these entities. The source code of YAGO is in this Github repo.
- [Zhishi.me](http://zhishi.me/) - Knowledge Graph data extracted from the largest Chinese encyclopedias, Baidu Baike, Hudong Baike and Chinese Wikipedia.

# Semantic Network Dataset
- [ConceptNet](http://conceptnet.io/) - ConceptNet is a freely-available semantic network, designed to help computers understand the meanings of words that people use.
- [Microsoft Concept Graph](https://concept.research.microsoft.com/) - For Short Text Understanding
- [OpenHowNet](https://openhownet.thunlp.org/) - An Open Sememe-based Lexical Knowledge Base in Chinese.
- [WordNet](http://wordnet.princeton.edu/) - A free large lexical database of English from Princeton University.

# Academic Dataset
- [AMiner](https://www.aminer.cn/) - Aminer aims to provide comprehensive search and mining services for researcher social networks.
- [Microsoft Academic](https://academic.microsoft.com/) - Microsoft Academic (MA) employs advances in machine learning, semantic inference and knowledge discovery to help you explore scholarly information in more powerful ways than ever before.
- [AceMap](https://www.acemap.info/) - Academic search engine based on knowledge graph which includes entities like paper, author, institution and etc.
